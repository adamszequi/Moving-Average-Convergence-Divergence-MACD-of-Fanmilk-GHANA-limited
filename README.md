# Moving-Average-Convergence-Divergence-MACD-of-Fanmilk-GHANA-limited
The moving average convergence divergence  is similar in
spirit to an absolute price oscillator in that it establishes the difference between a fast
exponential moving average and a slow exponential moving average. However, in the case
of MACD, we apply a smoothing exponential moving average to the MACD value itself in
order to get the final signal output from the MACD indicator. Optionally, you may also
look at the difference between MACD values and the EMA of the MACD values (signal)
and visualize it as a histogram.[ A properly configured MACD signal can successfully
capture the direction, magnitude, and duration of a trending instrument price]
